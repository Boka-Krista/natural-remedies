# teas-for-health
Description of flowers, plants and spices which you can use as an tea or part of your diet, and what health benefits it holds. I also tried to add some possible side effects they may hold. So in case you have some more serious health problems, I suggest to consult with your family medicine docots before adding them in your diet.

Ever since childhood during spring or summer in our countryside me and relatives would go out in the fields to collect various plants and dry them for later use in teas. So Since then I knew the benefits of few of them, recently been "digging" a little deeper into them, and found some valuable information about them, and apparently for those plants are even more uses as I thought. And interestinly enough, many of them can be grown at home/ garden as well. All that tips I've found included into website - what spot, soil it prefers and when would bt the best time for harvesting.


## UX


The idea of website was created as a little challenge for myself, as there are now added several things I never tried before, such as side bar (in one of previous pages I did only horizontal with "hamburger" dropdown menu), decided to try on funcional searchbar and also adding modals to images, which I think was hardest bit for me to fully figure out. 



### Colour Scheme



Homepage: red for highlighted text, yellow for highlighted background, lavanderblush for main text, rgba(166, 237, 175, 0.6) for backup background colour ||
Better sleep: #6ae7f3 and #99aef2 for background colour and black for text. ||
Colds: lightcoral and lightpink for background and black for text. ||
Cough: lightgreen and yellowgreen for background colour and black for text. ||
Fever: grey and lightgrey as background colour and black for text. ||
Focus: rgb(221,170,187) and rgb(173,116,135) for background and default (black) for text. ||
Headaches: rgb(124,164,85) and rgb(183,240,125) for background colour and default for text. ||
Skin: gold and rgb(231,213,112) background and default text. ||
Stomach: rgb(208,154,54) and orange background and default text. ||
